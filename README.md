DROP - can delete all the user names and password

Quick Intro on SQL-Injections 

Attackers often use many SQL injections to exploit vulnerabilities as it is one of the most effective and command methods. 
SQL Injections are capable of completely wiping out a database with DROP (luckily attackers are mostly trying to steal user names and passwords and THEN maybe delete your info lol) Bigger websites that are properly hardened such as facebook, Instragram, among others, 
are using what is called input sanitazion. This blocks the characters that are used in the syntax of an SQL injection. However, smaller websites, are often still vulnerable.

A quick lesson on the commands 
CREATE SELECT UPDATE INSERT DELETE DROP***
Super explanatory and super basic. Easy day.
